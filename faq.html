				<h3>Who is POP for?</h3>
				<p>
					POP is for everyone who wants fast and reliable messaging and calls. Business users and small teams may like the large groups, usernames, desktop apps and powerful file sharing options.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since POP groups can have up to 10,000 members, we support replies, mentions and hashtags that help maintain order and keep communication in large communities efficient. You can appoint admins with advanced tools to help these communities prosper in peace. Public groups can be joined by anyone and are powerful platforms for discussions and collecting feedback.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In case you're more into pictures, POP has animated gif search, a state of the art photo editor, and an open sticker platform (find some cool stickers here or here). What‘s more, there is no need to worry about disk space on your device. With POP's cloud support and cache management options, POP can take up nearly zero space on your phone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Those looking for extra privacy should check out our advanced settings and rather revolutionary policy. And if you want secrecy, try our device-specific Secret Chats with self-destructing messages, photos, and videos — and lock your app with an additional passcode.
                </p>
                <h3>How is POP different from WhatsApp?</h3>
				<p>
                    Unlike WhatsApp, POP is a cloud-based messenger with seamless sync. As a result, you can access your messages from several devices at once, including tablets and computers, and share an unlimited number of photos, videos and files (doc, zip, mp3, etc.) of up to 1 GB each. And if you don't want to store all that data on your device, you can always keep it in the cloud.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to our multi-data center infrastructure and encryption, POP is faster and way more secure. On top of that, POP is free and will stay free — no ads, no subscription fees, forever.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our API is open, and we welcome developers to create their own POP apps. We also have a Bot API, a platform for developers that allows anyone to easily build specialized tools for POP, integrate any services, and even accept payments from users around the world.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And that‘s just the tip of the iceberg. Don’t forget to check out this paragraph for even more exclusive stuff.
